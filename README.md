# TIC-TAC-TOE (PROJECT ZERO)

A working version of the game is hosted at:
https://zimbee74.github.io/tic-tac-toe/

## INTRODUCTION:
The way the game works is player one drops an X into the square of their choice and then
player 2 drops an O with a click onto the square of their choice.

I have taken the approach of creating 2 different versions one is the Vanilla Javascript version and the other is Jquery. This approach was taken to facilitate my learning and development. In particular I wanted to get more experience with IF/ELSE/ELSEIF statements and FOR loops and other core aspects of learning programming.

## TECHNOLOGY USED:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript (Vanilla at this stage)
* Jquery version will be created as well

## FEATURES:
* Players play until a winner is detected and declared by the system.
* Upon victory the players can hit reset to begin a new game.
* The game detects win states and also detects a draw.
* The "reset game" code resets only certain required aspects of the game. The intention of this is to allow the game to hold match scores when this functionality is fully implemented.

### FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
* The use of 3D CSS to improve the aesthetics of the game.
* Finishing of a scoreboard that tracks successive games between players.
* Implementation of a Jquery version of the game.
